Dr. Tomoji Ozeki, Department of Chemistry and Material Science, Tokyo Institute
of Technology, noticed that the old version of SYMMOL, when treats a group with
degenerated inertia moment, does not minimize the RMS. The new version does.
The difference, in terms of RMS, is in the range 0.5*RMSold < RMSmin < RMSold;
in terms of symmetrized coordinates the difference is very small.
